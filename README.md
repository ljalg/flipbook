A concept for a web application which tracks objects and their relationships with other objects

The idea for this project started with the desire to be able to fully link Sharepoint tables, which they are getting closer to..
but basically have an online database which is eaiser to manage then current tools allow.

The idea transformed into a way to track objects, the object's properties, it's relationships with other objects and those relationship properties.

The use case I came up with first would allow a server admin to identify all of the people who would be affected if a particular server was turned off or disrupted.  Connecting objects Server > Software > Service > Customer allows this to happen.  But server manager, software manager, software license, etc. could be thrown into the mix to really track everything about that server.
