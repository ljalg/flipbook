A concept for a web application which tracks objects and their relationships with other objects

The idea for this project started with the desire to be able to fully link Sharepoint tables, which they are getting closer to.. but basically to have an online database which is eaiser to manage and a front end to display the data.

The idea transformed into a way to track objects, the object's properties, it's relationships with other objects and those relationship properties.

The first use case I came up with would allow a server administrator to identify all of the people who would be affected if a particular server was turned off or disrupted.  Connecting objects Server > Software > Service > Customer allows this to happen.  But server manager, software manager, software license, etc. could be thrown into the mix to really track everything about that chain.

Another use case could be a car rental company where each car and customer could be a different object and their relationship could have properties such as start date/time, end date/time, cost, miles driven, etc.

I added visualizations to allow a big picture view of the relationships between objects and what objects might be dependent on others.
